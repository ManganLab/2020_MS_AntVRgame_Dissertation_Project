# Dissertation Project
## The repository for my 3rd year dissertation project about the Ant VR game

The goal of the project is to communicate Dr. Michael Mangan’s biorobotics group’s scientific challenges to the
general public, especially future computer scientists and robotics engineers.

The plan is to accomplish this, by making a virtual reality video game in Unity for the Oculus Rift, where the player becomes a
desert ant, with simulated vision and senses, and has to navigate through its habitat in 3D space.
